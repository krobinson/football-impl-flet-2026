# Specification Quality Checklist: Schedule Group Stage Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All three user stories are P1 — they form a single coherent "schedule tab" experience and have no value independently; the spec treats them as one MVP slice.
- UTC-only time display is an explicit assumption — local time conversion is deferred.
- The group selector UI style (chips vs tabs) is intentionally left to the planning phase.
